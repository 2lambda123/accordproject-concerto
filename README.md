## Introduction

Concerto is a lightweight 100% JavaScript schema language and runtime. It works in both a Node.js process and in your browser.

This is why you should care: https://www.accordproject.org/news/strongly-typed-data-for-javascript-and-beyond/

Things you can do using Concerto:
- Define an object-oriented model using a domain-specific language that is much easier to read and write than JSON/XML Schema, XMI or equivalents. The metamodel gives you "just enough" expressivity to capture real-world business models, while remaining easy to map to most runtime environments.
- Optionally edit your models using a powerful [VS Code add-on](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=accordproject.cicero-vscode-extension) with syntax highlighting and validation
- Create runtime instances of your model
- Serialize your instances to JSON
- Deserialize (and optionally validate) instances from JSON
- Instances are JS objects so they are easy to pass around your application
- Introspect the model using a powerful set of APIs
- Convert the model to other formats: JSON Schema, XML Schema, Java, Go, Typescript, Loopback, PlantUML using [concerto-tools](https://github.com/accordproject/concerto/tree/master/packages/concerto-tools).
- Import models from URLs
- Publish your reusable models to any website, including the Accord Project Open Source model repository, hosted at: https://models.accordproject.org

## Structure of the Code Repository

Top level repository (concerto), with sub packages. Each sub-package is published as an independent npm module using `lerna`:
* [concerto-cli](https://github.com/accordproject/concerto/tree/master/packages/concerto-cli) : command-line interface for Concerto
* [concerto-core](https://github.com/accordproject/concerto/tree/master/packages/concerto-core) : core library for model management/parsing/validation/serialization
* [concerto-tools](https://github.com/accordproject/concerto/tree/master/packages/concerto-tools) : model converters and tools for Concerto model files
* [concerto-util](https://github.com/accordproject/concerto/tree/master/packages/concerto-util) : contains utility functions used in other parts of the code and fundamentally independent from Concerto as a modeling language
* [concerto-metamodel](https://github.com/accordproject/concerto/tree/master/packages/concerto-metamodel) : contains utility functions for accessing and manipulating the new Concerto metamodel
* [concerto-cto](https://github.com/accordproject/concerto/tree/master/packages/concerto-cto) : contains the parser for the .cto syntax for Concerto. The parser now outputs a proper Concerto object, instance of the metamodel rather than a custom JSON object.
* [concerto-vocabulary](https://github.com/accordproject/concerto/tree/master/packages/concerto-vocabulary) : contains new functionality to handle model vocabularies

# Installation

To install the command-line interface:

```
npm install -g @accordproject/concerto-cli
```

You may also set a custom folder to keep the log files by setting the following environment variable:

```
export CONCERTO_LOG_FOLDER_PATH="/tmp"
```

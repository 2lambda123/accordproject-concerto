# Hyperledger Composer Concerto

Concerto is a lightweight 100% JavaScript schema language and runtime. It works in both a Node.js process and in your browser. The browserified version of Concerto is Â±50KB.

Things you can do using Concerto:
- Define an object-oriented model using a human-readable domain-specific language that is much easier to read and write than JSON/XML Schema, XMI or equivalents. The metamodel gives you "just enough" expressivity to capture real-world business models, while remaining easy to map to most runtime environments.
- Use a powerful VS Code add-on with syntax highlighting and validation
- Create runtime instances of your model
- Serialize your instances to JSON
- Deserialize (and optionally validate) instances from JSON
- Introspect the model
- Convert the model to other formats: JSON Schema, XML Schema, Java, Go, Typescript, Loopback, PlantUML...
- Import models from URLs
- Publish your models to the Accord Project Open Source model repository, hosted at: https://models.accordproject.org
